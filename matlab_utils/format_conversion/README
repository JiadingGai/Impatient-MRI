This folder demonstrates an example of converting into IMPATIENT data format, 
an MRI data stored in Matlab's mat file (i.e., recon_data_32x32x4.mat).

Hopefully, this example will save our users' the pain to figure out the hard
way how to convert their favorite MRI data format into the IMPATIENT's format.

data_interface.m first loads in all the MRI data vectors stored in 
recon_data_32x32x4.mat, and then write them in the IMPATIENT's format by 
call datawrite.m. The converted data is stored under the 32x32x4 directory, 
which can serve as the direct input to IMPATIENT for reconstruction:

        $> ./mriSolver -idir matlab_utils/format_conversion/32x32x4 -cg_num 10  \
                       -toeplitzGridding -ntime_segs 8 -fdp 1e4 \
                       -gridOS_Q 1.125 -gridOS_FH 1.375
